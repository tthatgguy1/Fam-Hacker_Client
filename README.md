####    What is Termux-Torrent?    ####
<Whenever you want to download any movie or file using torrent, you first have to install U torrent or bit torrent application from the play store, and these are called torrent clients. The torrent clients help you to download the torrent data using . torrent file. These applications take space on your phone, auto start and make your phone slow, and they even show annoying ads. Since you are a termux user, there is a better alternative to download data from torrent and that is Termux-Torrent tool. This tool is going to help to download any .torrent file data with just 3 clicks.>

<Termux-Torrent tool is really lightweight and works perfectly. Just install this tool and your termux have a capability of a torrent client.
